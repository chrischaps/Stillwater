# Stillwater — Production Roadmap (v1.0)

*A practical, milestone-driven plan for delivering Stillwater from pre-production to launch.*

---

# 0. Guiding Principles
- Atmosphere over content volume  
- Systems-driven narrative  
- Esoteric mechanics optional, not required  
- Asynchronous multiplayer should feel invisible and thematic  
- Small maps, high density, low noise  
- No prescriptive player arcs  

---

# 1. Phase 1 — Pre-Production Finalization (2–4 weeks)

## Goals
- Lock core system architecture  
- Finalize GDD + TDD (completed)  
- Establish Unity project scaffold  
- Build early technical prototypes  

## Deliverables
- Unity project initialized  
- Pixel-perfect camera test  
- Tilemap & sorting prototype  
- Basic fishing FSM  
- Fake Echo backend simulation  
- Mood & anomaly sample tests  

## Exit Criteria
- Fishing prototype feels correct  
- Tilemaps render properly  
- Echo system simulated locally  
- Scope validated  

---

# 2. Phase 2 — Vertical Slice (6–10 weeks)

## Goals
A polished, miniature representation of the full game.

### Vertical Slice Includes:
- 1 zone (Starting Lake)  
- 2–3 fish  
- 1 anomaly  
- Journal v1  
- Mock async system  
- Ambient NPC  

## Exit Criteria
- The slice feels atmospheric, strange, meditative  
- Confirms identity of the game  

---

# 3. Phase 3 — Core Systems Production (8–14 weeks)

## Systems to Build
- Fishing System v2  
- Lake Watcher v2  
- Anomaly System v2  
- Async Multiplayer v1  
- Journal System v2  
- NPC Framework  

## Exit Criteria
- All systems functional  
- Fishing supports long play sessions  
- Anomalies integrate cleanly  

---

# 4. Phase 4 — World Content Production (6–10 weeks)

## Zones
- Starting Lake  
- Forest River  
- Crescent Cove  
- Night Marsh  
- Deepwater Inlet  

### Per-Zone Requirements
- Tilemap design  
- 3–6 fish  
- 1 anomaly  
- Ambient SFX  
- NPC interactions  
- Echo-influenced variables  

## Exit Criteria
- All zones traversable and distinct  

---

# 5. Phase 5 — Asynchronous Strand System Finalization (6–8 weeks)

## Features
- EchoCurrents  
- Rarity drift  
- Zone drift  
- Residue markers  
- Shared journal variants  
- Weather seeds from global state  

## Testing
- Load testing  
- Privacy validation  
- Global balancing  

## Exit Criteria
- The lake feels subtly shared  
- Global trends never dominate local play  

---

# 6. Phase 6 — Content Polishing (8–12 weeks)

## Enhancements
- Fishing feel tuning  
- Camera & weather transitions  
- Anomaly timing & pacing  
- Soundscape refinement  
- Tilemap polish  
- Journal, object, fish text  
- Secrets & esoteric interactions  

## Targets
- 40–60 fish species  
- 20+ objects  
- 12+ anomalies  
- 50+ journal entries  
- 6–12 global “echo touchpoints”  

## Exit Criteria
- Cohesive world  
- Optional esoteric depth feels rewarding  

---

# 7. Phase 7 — QA & Optimization (4–8 weeks)

## Technical QA
- Profiling  
- Shader fallback  
- Memory audits  
- Async networking validation  

## Gameplay QA
- Fishing balance  
- Ritual discovery  
- Anomaly escalation curve  
- Journal legibility  

## Exit Criteria
- Zero critical bugs  
- Smooth 60fps on target hardware  

---

# 8. Phase 8 — Beta, Feedback, Iteration (4–6 weeks)

## Closed Beta
Measures:
- Stillness patterns  
- Ritual discovery  
- Emotional beats  
- Early UX clarity  

## Exit Criteria
- Players understand the experience without explanation  
- Tone validated  

---

# 9. Phase 9 — Launch Prep (3–6 weeks)

## Tasks
- Store pages  
- Trailer  
- Press kits  
- Backend scaling  
- Steam Deck passes  
- Final build certification  

## Exit Criteria
- Release-ready  

---

# 10. Phase 10 — Post-Launch Support (Ongoing)

## Cadence
- Weekly → Monthly patches  
- Adjust Echo rules  
- Bug fixes  
- Seasonal anomalies  

## Optional Additions
- New zones  
- New moods  
- New anomaly classes
